## Overview

In this project, I applied my extensive broadcast engineering knowledge to implement **Video over IP (VoIP) technology** for a new TV channel. VoIP technology replaces traditional SDI (Serial Digital Interface) infrastructure with a more flexible, scalable, and cost-efficient IP-based solution. This shift allowed us to streamline video transmission, improve production workflows, and enable seamless remote operation.

## Key Features

- **IP-Based Video Transmission**: Replaced SDI with IP technology for faster and more reliable video delivery over Ethernet networks.
- **Seamless Remote Production**: Enabled real-time, collaborative production from multiple locations using IP video feeds.
- **Network Redundancy**: Implemented redundant IP links to ensure continuous operation with minimal downtime.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built a system that can easily scale as new channels and content streams are added.

## Technologies Used

- **SMPTE 2110**: Used the SMPTE 2110 standard for professional media over IP networks, ensuring high-quality, low-latency video and audio transmission.
- **NDI (Network Device Interface)**: Integrated NDI to facilitate low-latency video sharing between different devices in the broadcast workflow.
- **VSM (Virtual Studio Manager)**: Managed IP routing and control through VSM, improving flexibility in signal management.
- **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Deployed production and playout servers on VMs for easier resource management and redundancy.
- **Containers (Docker)**: Used containers to isolate production services, enabling fast deployment and scaling.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was **managing latency and synchronization** across multiple IP streams, which required precise configuration of network switches and routing paths. Additionally, integrating legacy SDI equipment with the new IP infrastructure posed some challenges. My experience in **MCR operations** was essential in troubleshooting these issues and ensuring seamless video transmission throughout the production process.

## Outcome

The new IP-based workflow has significantly **enhanced flexibility and scalability**. The channel is now capable of remote production, allowing for quick deployment of new content streams with minimal effort. This transition to **Video over IP technology** has improved both efficiency and broadcast quality, paving the way for future innovations in the channelâ€™s operations.
